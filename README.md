SourceCode folder includes the code and the libraries used in the program.
Examples represent some examples generated by the program.
/*
  GreedySpanner.jar is an executable jar file can be executed by double click or accessed by command line.
  Blocked by the gmail, so I took this file away.
*/

SouceCode:
DrawSpanner.java is a class with main function to draw the UI and show the graph.
Dijkstra.java is a class for implementing the Dijkstra Algorithm to get the shortest path.
Line.java is a class for drawing the line.
Ring.java is a class for drawing the ring.
PointsByDistance is a class for calculating the distance of each pair of points in increasing order. 

Application step:
1. Pick several points on the canvas.
2. Insert t in the menu item (If no inster, default is 1).
3. Click the 'Compute' button then will show the t spanner graph.
4. Click the 'Show' button in the menu item will show the pair with biggest spanning ratio.
5. Press 'Clear' button can clean the canvas (but t will not be changed).
6. Click the existed point will delete that point and all the edges will clear until press 'Compute' again to have a new spanner graph (t remains).
